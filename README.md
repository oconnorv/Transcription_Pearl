# Transcription Pearl

A Python-based GUI application for transcribing and processing images containing historical handwritten text using Large Language Models (LLMs) via API services (OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic APIs). Designed for academic and research purposes.

## Manual

There is also a Transcription Pearl Manual available in the repository in PDF format with instructions on how to get and insert API keys as well as information on the various commands and functions.

## Recent Updates: 11 November 2024

MAJOR UPDATE: 1.0 beta Release

- Includes Image Preprocessing Utility
- Includes better functionality for storing settings
- Drag and drop functionality for PDFs
- Automatic rotation of photographs captured with phone cameras
- Ability to manually rotate images
- Ability to manually delete images
- Resizable image and text windows
- New requirements text (adds opencv-python==4.10.0.84)

Previous Update: 08 November 2024

There was an issue with the prompts file that was preventing the transcribed text from being sent to the correction function. The prompt was missing the {text_to_process} placeholder. That has now been fixed.

PDFs were also being imported at 72 DPI and this has been changed to 300 DPI which should improve readability.

## Overview

Transcription Pearl helps researchers process and transcribe image-based documents using various AI services. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing transcription projects and leverages multiple AI providers for optimal results.

## Features

- Multi-API OCR capabilities (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)
- Batch processing of images
- Text correction and validation
- PDF import and processing
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Project management system
- Find and replace functionality
- Progress tracking
- Multiple text draft versions
- Image Pre-Processsing Tool
- Google Vision OCR option with hOCR export (requires Vision API key)

## Prerequisites
